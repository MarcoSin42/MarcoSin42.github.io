Recently, I've been learning to use C++.  Recently, I've learned I don't know as much C++ as I think.  Nothing has exposed me as much as Cmake has.  I feel like I've been using more magical incantations than usual, i.e. I don't really know what I'm doing or the specific keywords I'm doing and moreso just hacking until I get the result I want.  This is mostly due to CMake.

What I find frustrating about CMake is that there are dozens of ways to do the **same** thing (why?!).  Furthermore, information on the internet is often outdated and may not be relevant, I don't know particular reasons to choose one version of CMake over another.  

In contrast, Rust,arguably C++'s competitor, has much less verbose packagement.  It is a *breeze* to use and is not unlike Python in terms of ease of use.  I've spent days just trying to bend CMake to my will whereas I could get Cargo, Rust's build management System, to work in less than a few hours.  CMake is the only case I know of where the build management system is harder than the language itself (god help me if I find a worse example).

**Fuck you CMake.**
